In Pod Panic, you must guide your pod from the bay out into the open sea to avoid extinction.

Pod Panic is a side-scrolling survival game in which you must eat fish, avoid the poisonous (pink) fish, and avoid fishing nets, barrels, and oil slicks.

As the levels progress, the gameplay speeds up and more enemies spawn, with fewer fish for you to regain your health from.

Tap the up and down arrows or W and S to change between the three swimming lanes. Hold the right arrow or D to swim forward. Let go of the right arrow or D to drift back to the edge of the screen. Enter or Space (Action) to select/advance to next level, Esc (Back) to pause. It is a bit easier to move if you tap up and down instead of holding the keys.

Install instructions are on the downloads page.
